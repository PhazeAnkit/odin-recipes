# odin-recipes

Welcome to **odin-recipes** — a beginner-friendly recipe website built entirely with HTML.

This was created as part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It’s a small but meaningful milestone where I practiced the basics of HTML by building a functional (and delicious-looking) site that features some of my favorite recipes.

No frameworks. No styling. Just pure, clean HTML.

## 🍴 Features

- Multiple recipe pages linked together
- Simple navigation using internal hyperlinks
- Built with semantic HTML tags for clarity and structure
- Fully hand-coded without any CSS or JavaScript (for now!)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I got hands-on experience with:

- Setting up the structure of an HTML document
- Creating multiple pages and linking them together
- Organizing content using headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Writing cleaner, more readable HTML using semantic tags

## 🚀 What’s Next

This is just the appetizer — here’s what I plan to add as I level up:

- Add CSS to make it visually appealing
- Make the layout responsive for mobile and tablets
- Add images and media to each recipe
- Improve accessibility and use best practices for structure
